Going for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

My plan is to become a video game developer, but who knows? Plans can change.

### Projects
---

VirtualComputer is a new project of mine where I am hoping to emulate a computer. In the end, I want users to be able to write code similar to assembly, and
have it assembled to be executed on the virtual computer. I am making this partially because I'm interested in how computers work and this can help with
my understanding, but it will also result in my understanding of assembly better, and it might make for some interesting assembly programming for other people as well.

The PixelEngine repo is my biggest project, it's a small game engine used to make arcade style games in Java.
A game can be made as fast as a day, or could take longer to make something bigger, or even multiplayer.

HungerPixels is using a slightly older (and modified) version of the PixelEngine to make a multiplayer game.
That game shows that the engine does not handle multiplayer well yet, but will help me fix that.

BattlePixels is the original game I made to test out drawing pixels on a screen in Java, and the basic parts were extracted to start the PixelEngine.
I do want to work on this game more and improve it in the future.
