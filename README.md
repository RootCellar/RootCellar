Going for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

My plan is to become a video game developer (or do as a hobby/side job while doing something else for work), but who knows? Plans can change.

### Experience
---

Known languages listed by comfort/skill/experience:

- Java: Learned 2016-2017, most comfortable with this language

- C++: Learned 2020-2021

- bash: may not technically be a "programming language", but do use on a regular basis

- Lua: used a little bit for programming in the ComputerCraft mod in Minecraft, and doing some Factorio server scripting. Only have basics.

- C: Only know some basic syntax, by way of knowing what C++ has that C doesn't. Haven't really used it though.

- Python: only know a couple things, want to learn this.

### Projects
---

- Apr 2021: CS202GroupProject is a project for class where we made a small game with graphics. This is the first real project I've worked on in C++,
and I have become more comfortable building larger things with this language because of this.

- Dec 2020: VirtualComputer is a new project of mine where I am hoping to emulate a computer. In the end, I want users to be able to write code similar to assembly, and
have it assembled to be executed on the virtual computer. I am making this partially because I'm interested in how computers work and this can help with
my understanding, but it will also result in my understanding of assembly better, and it might make for some interesting assembly programming for other people as well.

- Oct 2018: The PixelEngine repo is my biggest project, it's a small game engine used to make arcade style games in Java.
A game can be made as fast as a day, or could take longer to make something bigger, or even multiplayer.

- Dec 2018 - Dec 2019: HungerPixels is using a slightly older (and modified) version of the PixelEngine to make a multiplayer game.
That game shows that the engine does not handle multiplayer well yet, but will help me fix that.

- Mar 2018: BattlePixels is the original game I made to test out drawing pixels on a screen in Java, and the basic parts were extracted to start the PixelEngine.
I do want to work on this game more and improve it in the future.
