Going for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

My plan is to become a video game developer, but who knows? Plans can change.

#### Projects

The PixelEngine repo is my biggest project, it's a small game engine used to make arcade style games in Java.
A game can be made as fast as a day, or could take longer to make something bigger, or even multiplayer.

HungerPixels is using a slightly older (and modified) version of the PixelEngine to make a multiplayer game.
That game shows that the engine does not handle multiplayer well yet, but will help me fix that.
